<h1>Welcome to My Deep Learning Journey</h1>
<p>This repo will contain not only code related to neural nets and deep learning models but will also cover some detailed descriptions of things like activation functions, different learning algorithims and also a in dept explanation of the different complex models themselves. I will begin my updating the repo with any and all information i imbibe from the Deep learning course by Andrew Ng which hopefully tranistion in further learning learning the latest and greatest in nural nets and will try and implement those in python and tensorflow especially. I hope you find the information contained in this repo useful</p>
